# tmux-nowplaying-macos

A tmux plugin that displays currently playing media from macOS's system-wide Now Playing widget. Works with any app that reports to the macOS media control center including web browsers, Spotify, Apple Music, and more.

## Features

- üéµ Shows currently playing media from any macOS app
- üåê Works with web-based players (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.)
- üéß Supports Spotify, Apple Music, and all media apps
- ‚ö° Uses macOS's native MediaRemote framework
- üéØ No external dependencies (pure Swift + bash)
- üîß Customizable icons and formatting

## Requirements

- macOS 10.15 or later
- tmux 2.9 or later
- Swift runtime (included with macOS)

## Installation

### Using [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (recommended)

Add plugin to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
set -g @plugin 'barlevalon/tmux-nowplaying-macos'
```

Press `prefix + I` to install the plugin.

### Manual Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barlevalon/tmux-nowplaying-macos ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-nowplaying-macos
```

Add this to your `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
run-shell ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-nowplaying-macos/nowplaying.tmux
```

Reload tmux configuration:

```bash
tmux source ~/.tmux.conf
```

## Usage

Add the nowplaying command to your `status-left` or `status-right` in `~/.tmux.conf`:

```bash
# Direct command (recommended)
set -g status-right '#(~/.config/tmux/plugins/tmux-nowplaying-macos/scripts/nowplaying.sh) | %H:%M'

# Or use the interpolation (may require tmux restart)
set -g status-right '#{nowplaying} | %H:%M'
```

The plugin will display the currently playing track in the format: `‚ô™ Artist - Title`

## Configuration

### Customize Icons

```bash
# Playing icon (default: "‚ô™ ")
set -g @nowplaying_playing_icon "üéµ "

# Paused icon (default: "")
set -g @nowplaying_paused_icon "‚è∏ "

# Stopped icon (default: "")
set -g @nowplaying_stopped_icon "‚èπ "
```

### Auto-update

The plugin automatically updates when tmux refreshes the status bar. You can control the refresh rate:

```bash
# Refresh every 2 seconds (default: 15)
set -g status-interval 2
```

## How It Works

This plugin uses macOS's private MediaRemote framework to access the same "Now Playing" information that appears in Control Center. Unlike other solutions that are app-specific (like AppleScript for Music.app), this works with any media source on your system.

The plugin consists of:
1. A Swift script that interfaces with MediaRemote
2. A bash wrapper that integrates with tmux
3. TPM-compatible plugin structure

## Comparison with Other Solutions

| Feature | tmux-nowplaying-macos | tmux-spotify | nowplaying-cli |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Works with all media apps | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| No external dependencies | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| TPM compatible | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Maintained | ‚úÖ | ‚ùì | ‚ùì |
| Cross-platform | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

## Troubleshooting

### Nothing is displayed

1. Ensure media is actually playing in a supported app
2. Check that the script has execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-nowplaying-macos/scripts/*
   ```
3. Test the script directly:
   ```bash
   ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-nowplaying-macos/scripts/nowplaying.sh
   ```

### "No such file or directory" error

Make sure Swift is available:
```bash
swift --version
```

### Slow performance

The first run may be slower as Swift compiles the script. Subsequent runs will be faster.
